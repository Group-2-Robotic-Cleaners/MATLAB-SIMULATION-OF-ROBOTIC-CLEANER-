# MATLAB-SIMULATION-OF-ROBOTIC-CLEANER-
This project simulates a simple 2-wheeled robot using Simulink and Simscape Multibody. The robot can move forward, turn, and detect obstacles using basic sensors. The simulation includes a 3D view of the robot, wheels, ground, and objects, allowing real-time animation of the robotâ€™s motion and interaction with its environment.
