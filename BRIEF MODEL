 **Short Note on Simulink Model Structure (`automatic_vacuum.slx`)**

* The model uses **Simscape** and **SimMechanics** components.
* Simulation is configured in **normal mode** with data logging options set.
* The `blockdiagram.xml` file defines the **core system structure**, listing blocks and their types.
* Blocks are contained within `<System>` tags, each specifying:

  * `BlockType` (e.g., Gain, Sum, Constant)
  * `Name` (unique block identifiers)
* Additional files like `configSet0.xml` and `graphicalInterface.json` define simulation settings and visual layout.
